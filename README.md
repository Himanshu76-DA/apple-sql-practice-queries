# apple-sql-practice-queries
This project uses a mock Apple retail dataset, with SQL queries covering data exploration (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY), aggregation (SUM, COUNT, AVG), performance optimization (CREATE INDEX), and window functions (ROW_NUMBER, LAG). This repository demonstrates practical SQL skills for a data analyst role, focusing on business-relevant analysis.
